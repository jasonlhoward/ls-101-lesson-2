Write out pseudo-code (both casual and formal) that does the following:

1. a method that returns the sum of two integers

START

# Given two integers called integer1 and integer2

SET sum equals integer1 plus integer2

PRINT sum

END

2. a method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all 
those strings concatenated together

START

# Given a collection of strings called strings

SET iterator = 1
SET string = ''

WHILE iterator < length of strings
  GET value of the string within strings matching the location of the iterator
  SET string = previous value of string plus this new value
  SET iterator = iterator + 1

PRINT string

END

3. a method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with 
every other element

START

SET integers = a given array of integers
SET iterator = 1
SET new_array_of_integers = a new array

WHILE iterator < length of integers
  SET integer = value at location iterator from integers
  add integer to new_array_of_integers
  SET iterator = iterator + 2

PRINT new_array_of_integers

END
